⚙️ Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run EquipTrack on your local machine:

📌 1. Install Requirements

Install XAMPP

Install VS Code (optional but recommended)

📌 2. Move Project Folder

Place the project inside:

C:\xampp\htdocs\EquipTrack\

📌 3. Start XAMPP

From XAMPP Control Panel, start:

✔ Apache
✔ MySQL

📌 4. Import the Database

Go to:

http://localhost/phpmyadmin


Create a new database:

equiptrack


Import your SQL tables (users, orders, equipment)

📌 5. Update Database Config

Inside config.php:

$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "equiptrack";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

📌 6. Run the Project

Open browser and visit:

http://localhost/EquipTrack/index.html

🧪 Testing the Application
✔ Registration

→ Redirects to confirmation page
→ Entry appears in users table

✔ Login

→ Correct email + password redirects to home

✔ Order Submission

→ Order appears in orders table

✔ Password Reset

→ New hashed password saved
→ Redirects to confirmation page

🚨 Troubleshooting
❗ PHP code is visible instead of running

You opened the file directly:

file:///C:/users/...


✔ Instead, run through:

http://localhost/EquipTrack/

❗ Data not inserting

Check form action

Confirm config.php credentials

Enable error reporting:

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);

🌟 Future Enhancements

Admin dashboard

Add/edit/delete equipment

User roles (Admin / Customer)

Email notifications

Improved responsive UI

Online payment integration
